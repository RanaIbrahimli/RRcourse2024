  ## Analysis of Viewership Trends

The viewership data for *Game of Thrones* shows a significant increase in popularity as the series progresses. The first season started with relatively modest viewership numbers, but by the time the series reached its peak around seasons 4 and 5, the audience had grown considerably. 

However, viewership did not follow a strictly linear path. There were fluctuations, with some episodes experiencing a dip in viewership, often attributed to less favorable plot developments or competing TV shows. For instance, the viewership between episodes 3 and 5 in season 3 showed a slight decline, but it quickly picked up as the season progressed.

The final season, despite being highly anticipated, saw a polarized audience reaction, which was reflected in the viewership numbers. The first few episodes saw high viewership, but there was a noticeable drop by the series finale, indicating a mixed reception among fans.

Overall, *Game of Thrones* enjoyed a dramatic rise in viewership, making it one of the most-watched TV series in history, but it also faced challenges in maintaining consistent audience satisfaction towards the end.
